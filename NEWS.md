# nasapower 4.2.1

* Fixes [Issue](https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/issues/85) where querying all parameters failed.

# nasapower 4.2.0

## Minor Changes

* Two new functions are added:
  * `query_surfaces()`: Query the POWER API for Detailed Information on Wind Type Surfaces
  
  * `query_groupings()`: Query the POWER API for Detailed Information on Available Parameter Groupings
  
* `query_parameters` now allows you to retrieve rich metadata for the parameters.

* Error, warning and other informational messages are now all formatted with {cli} for more attractive and informative messages.

* The username passed along to the POWER API is now "nasapower4r" to support other packages built on {nasapower} that could use {vcr} in tests.
Previously the user agent string took the version of {nasapower} and appended it, _e.g._, "nasapower410" for v4.1.0.
Doing so breaks tests in packages relying on {nasapower} due to incompatibilities in cassettes, while not affecting functionality.

## Bug fixes

* Fixes a bug that allowed users to send requests to the API for hourly data over a region.
The API does not support this and this client now provides a user-friendly error when it is attempted.

# nasapower 4.1.0

## Bug fixes

* Fix formula in documentation that didn't display properly in HTML.

* Fix non-functional link in documentation.

* Fix code coverage badging.

## Minor changes

* Use {cli} and {rlang} for clear messages for end users.

* Use argument matching for function arguments where practical.

* The `temporal_api` argument of `get_power()` now defaults to "daily", previously it had no default value.

* The `temporal_average` argument for `get_power()` has now been removed after being deprecated and issuing a message to users to use `temporal_api` instead since release 4.0.0.

# nasapower 4.0.11

## Bug fixes

* Replaces `&` or `|` with the proper `&&` or `||`.

* Corrects documentation titles for functions to be title case.

* Fixes the CRAN badge in the README.

* Updates {vcr} configuration files for testing.

## Minor changes

* Reorder README to stress that this is not the data source and should not be cited as such.

* Tidy up minor bits-n-pieces in documentation to make it nicer, *e.g.*, grammar corrections, using `\dQuote{}` rather than """ in ROxygen.

* Uses `sprintf()` rather than `paste()` where possible.

* Update {vcr} configuration and infrastructure to use .json cassettes.

# nasapower 4.0.10

* Update CITATION file to follow CRAN's ~ever-changing whims~ guidelines.

# nasapower 4.0.9

* Remove an example that no longer works with the API.

* Remove incorrect documentation about rate limiting and include details on how to use rate limiting.

* Ensure tests are skipped on CRAN, thanks MaÃ«lle!

* Use `skip_if_offline()` rather than `skip_on_cran()` for tests.

# nasapower 4.0.8

* Redoc package to align with CRAN policies on well-formed HTML.

* Update list of allowed parameters for querying the API, ([18e4495e0ca2e9f14006260c019ac878a3023843](https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/commit/9ed90e0708a32650992795b818e1681e7150a0d9)).

* Updated test infrastructure.

# nasapower 4.0.7

* Adds new `time_standard` parameter to `get_power()` as requested in [##70](https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/issues/70).

* Updates internal list of accepted POWER parameters.

# nasapower 4.0.6

## Bug fixes

* Fixes bug when requesting `site_elevation`.
Thanks to @daniel_althoff for reporting this bug [Issue 69](https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/issues/69).

* Fixes bug where `wind_elevation` and `wind_surface` were not properly passed along to the API.

## Minor changes

* Fixes redundant and broken tests by removing or updating new tests.

# nasapower 4.0.5

* Fixes bug when requesting `site_elevation` corrected data.
Thanks to @daniel_althoff for reporting this bug [Issue 69](https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/issues/69).

# nasapower 4.0.4

## Bug fixes

* Fixes message when importing data using _vroom_ >= 1.5.0, `The `file` argument of `vroom()` must use `I()` for literal data as of vroom 1.5.0.`. Thanks to @palderman for the fix in [Pull Request 67](https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/pull/67).

## Minor changes

* Sets minimum version of _tibble_ necessary for use with _nasapower_.

# nasapower 4.0.3

* Fixes tests that should use _vcr_ or be skipped on CRAN.

# nasapower 4.0.2

* Update checks for number of parameters requested by user, maximum of 15 for hourly and 20 for all other temporal APIs.

* Return API messages to user to assist with troubleshooting when an error occurs server-side, see [Issue 55](https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/issues/55).

* The list of POWER parameters that can be queried from the API, `parameters`, is now in alphabetical order.

* Add paragraph to vignette describing how to work with possible rate limiting by API endpoints using _ratelimitr_.
This is in place of internally rate-limiting due to the way _ratelimitr_ handles function creation and the fact that the rate limits are extremely generous and may change as the project matures.

# nasapower 4.0.1 (unreleased on CRAN)

## Bug fixes

* Fixes a bug in where `NA` values were improperly handled.
Thanks to [@femiguez](https://github.com/femiguez) for the [Pull Request with the fix](https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/pull/56).

## Minor changes

* Enforces API limits client-side where the API limits unique queries to 30 per 60 seconds as found and reported by [@camwur](https://github.com/camwur) in [Issue 57](https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/issues/57).
This can be adjusted in future releases of _nasapower_ if the POWER API changes as has been indicated is possible.

* (Re)enables _vcr_ for better unit testing.

* More comprehensive unit tests.

# nasapower 4.0.0

## Major changes

* Adds support for new NASA POWER API v2.0, which includes new hourly data and other major changes to the API and available data.
See <https://power.larc.nasa.gov/> for fully detailed changes to the data.

* Drops support for the deprecated NASA POWER API V1.0.
Previous versions of _nasapower_ are no longer functional.

* Adds new function, `query_parameters()` to fetch information from the API on individual and all available community/temporal API combination parameters.

* Removes `SSE` community, replaced with `RE`.

* Removes `global` option for geographic coverage as passed along through the `latlon` argument of `get_power()`.

* Directly parse data from API response rather than downloading data to disk and importing.

* The `get_power()` arguments are changed:
  * two new arguments are added,
    * `wind_elevation`, and
    * `wind_surface`,
  * the `temporal_average` argument has been superseded by `temporal_api` to align with the terminology used in the POWER API.
  The `temporal_average` argument will still work, however, a message will be given if a user still uses `temporal_average` to alert the user of the change and ask them to update their scripts.


## Minor changes

* Improved documentation.

* Removes internal references to ICASA format files that are no longer supported in this client.

# nasapower 3.0.1

## Bug fixes

* Fix bug where Solar Radiation, "ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN", and perhaps others that were missed, return a numeric `-99.00` value rather than the proper `NA` for missing data.
Thanks to Fernando Miguez, <https://github.com/femiguez>, for the assistance in isolating the issue.

# nasapower 3.0.0

## Major Changes to Functionality

* Due to the removal of the CRAN package _APSIM_ from CRAN, the removal of the `create_met()` function has been implemented sooner than expected to keep _nasapower_ on CRAN.

* Deprecates `create_met()`

## Bug fixes

* Properly deprecates `create_icasa()`

# nasapower 2.0.0

## Bug Fixes

* Correct any missing or redirecting URLs

* Replace deprecated `subclass` with `class` in `new_tibble()`

## Major Changes to Functionality

* Following a UNIX-like philosophy, this release removes functionality to write APSIM .met and DSSAT ICASA files to disk.
_nasapower_ now will only fetch the appropriate data and return a `tibble()` object in-session, please use [apsimx](https://cran.r-project.org/package=apsimx) or the POWER web API data access viewer, <https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/>, for fetching and/or writing .met or .icasa files, respectively.
Note that  `create_icasa()` ideally should have been deprecated, but the server was not responding properly when queried for some time before the current release of _nasapower_ so the function has been removed.

* Add ability to `get_power()` to accept a user-provided `site_elevation` parameter that is passed to the API.
When this is used it will return a corrected atmospheric pressure value adjusted to the elevation provided.

## Minor and Internal Changes

* Use newest values from POWER team to validate user inputs for API requests, see <https://github.com/ropensci/nasapower/issues/48> for more.

* Replace _raster_ with _terra_ for examples of converting to spatial data in vignettes

* Use _vcr_ for enhanced testing

* Refactor the internal handling of temporary files to allow for more efficient use of the _future_ package
