## POWER data vs {nasapower}

Please note that {nasapower} is **NOT** the source of NASA POWER data.
It is only an API client that allows easy access to the data.
{nasapower} does not redistribute the data or provide it in any way, *we encourage users to follow the requests of the POWER Project Team and properly acknowledge them for the data rather than citing this package* (unless you have actually used it in your work).

  >*When POWER data products are used in a publication, we request the following acknowledgement be included:
   "The data was obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center (LaRC) Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER) Project funded through the NASA Earth Science/Applied Science Program."*

The previous statement that properly cites the POWER data is different than the citation for {nasapower}.
To cite this R package, {nasapower}, please use the output from `citation(package = "nasapower")` and cite both the package manual, which includes the version you used and the paper which refers to the peer-review of the software package as the functionality of the package has changed and will likely change to match the API in the future as necessary.

## About {nasapower}

{nasapower} aims to make it quick and easy to automate *downloading* of the [NASA-POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov) global meteorology, surface solar energy and climatology data in your R session as a tidy data frame `tibble` object for analysis and use in modelling or other purposes.
POWER (Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resource) data are freely available for download with varying spatial resolutions dependent on the original data and with several temporal resolutions depending on the POWER parameter and community.

**Note that the data are not static and may be replaced with improved data.**
Please see <https://power.larc.nasa.gov/docs/services/> for detailed information in this regard.

### Quick start

{nasapower} can easily be installed using the following code.

#### From CRAN

The stable version is available through CRAN.

```{r install-cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nasapower")
```

#### From GitHub for the version in-development

A development version is available through GitHub.

```{r install-dev, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("nasapower", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

### Example

Fetch daily “ag” community temperature, relative humidity and precipitation for January 1, 1985 for Kingsthorpe, Queensland, Australia.

```{r kingsthorpe}
library("nasapower")
daily_ag <- get_power(
  community = "ag",
  lonlat = c(151.81, -27.48),
  pars = c("RH2M", "T2M", "PRECTOTCORR"),
  dates = "1985-01-01",
  temporal_api = "daily"
)
daily_ag
```
