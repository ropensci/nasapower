Description: An API client for NASA POWER global meteorology, surface
    solar energy and climatology data API.  POWER (Prediction Of Worldwide
    Energy Resources) data are freely available for download with varying
    spatial resolutions dependent on the original data and with several
    temporal resolutions depending on the POWER parameter and community.
    This work is funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate Applied
    Science Program.  For more on the data themselves, the methodologies
    used in creating, a web- based data viewer and web access, please see
